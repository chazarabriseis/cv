This time we would tackle the Overland Track from the back and hike in from Lake St Claire to the Pine Valley Hut. It is situated right next to the Du Cane Ranges, another amazing dolorite range with lots of day walks and climbing opportunities. Our packs were super heavy, loaded with all the camping & climbing gear plus food for 4 nights and a wine bottle from Claire for Christmas…yes, Jeremy carried a glass wine bottle in, and two VB cans as our Christmas present…gotta love your Aussie! Hence we decided to take the ferry for the first 16km and only hike 10km to the hut, at a 28degree day with 30kg+ packs actually enough. The hut is nested in between beautiful temperate rainforest, we choose to pitch our tent just before the hut next to the creek, such a magical spot (I shouldn’t mention the mosquitos every night after sunset). After setting up our camp we headed up to the Labyrinth, a beautiful plateau at 1300m with lakes and views to Mount Geryon and The Acropolis, two peaks of the Range which we planned to climb. <br> The next day we headed of to climb the west face of The Acropolis, a 7pitch grade 15 climb. The forecast for the day was 30+, so we chose the face that would be in the shade the longest. Getting to the start of the climb involved already a 2hour climb scrambling along the rock face next to a 200m drop. Unfortunately the area of the climb showed a rockfall that must have occurred just recently and we decided to give that one a miss, no need to kill each other on Christmas day by kicking loose rocks on our heads. So we just followed the normal route up to the top. We were lucky with the weather and enjoyed amazing views, in all directions wildness and no sign of civilisation at all. What a great Christmas day topped with a nice dinner and a good bottle of wine. <br> The next day the forecast predicted showers so we used it as an excuse to take a rest day, the two very hot days with lots of action took it out of us and we were planning a 12hour+ day to climb Mount Geryon the next day. It was nice to just relax, read and enjoy our amazing campspot which we had all to ourselves. <br> To allow us enough time for the climb next day we got up early and started hiking at 6:30am. To get to the base of the mountain we had to follow a path that is not shown in maps and is only marked by little orange strings tied to trees. It was quite amazing, if you lost the path you were lost and had to backtrack to the last orange string and look for the next walking in all possible direction. We got the hang of it after a while and felt like the turtles from ‘Finding Nemo’ in the current…once you were in it it was easy but if you didn’t pay attention you were out of it. 4hours later of path finding and scrambling up to the mountain face we finally started our 5 pitch grade 9 climb up to the Foresight peak of Mount Geryon. It was a great place to climb, the peak is in-between the intimidating North and South peak. It was good and exposed climbing. Unfortunately the clouds arrived with us on the peak that fits maximum 4 people. Apparently this mountain gets climbed twice a year, that’s how remote the area is. After a quick celebration sandwich we continued our journey down to beat the clouds coming in. Three 50m abseils, 2hours down scramble and the flow through the orange stream we returned 13.5hours later at our campsite, what an epic adventure. <br> The predicted rain started during the night and didn’t stop for the next 24hours. Our paradise turned into one big puddle and we woke up in a water bed since our tent was pitch in the middle of it…our ropes stored next to the tent soked up all the water to make sure we got a proper work-out on the way out. After hiking out in the rain, which completed to hike in all different weather conditions in Tasmania, we took the ferry back to civilisation and a nice steak for dinner, it tasted like the best steak ever, how sweet are these treats after 5days in the wild.",
