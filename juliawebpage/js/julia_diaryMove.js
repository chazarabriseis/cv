		"text": "After having spent some days at the beach and with a good weather forecast for the mountains we decided to head back to the western wilderness and spend Christmas in the mountains. This time we would tackle the Overland Track from the back and hike in from Lake St Claire to the Pine Valley Hut. It is situated right next to the Du Cane Ranges, another amazing dolorite range with lots of day walks and climbing opportunities. Our packs were super heavy, loaded with all the camping & climbing gear plus food for 4 nights and a wine bottle from Claire for Christmas…yes, Jeremy carried a glass wine bottle in, and two VB cans as our Christmas present…gotta love your Aussie! Hence we decided to take the ferry for the first 16km and only hike 10km to the hut, at a 28degree day with 30kg+ packs actually enough. The hut is nested in between beautiful temperate rainforest, we choose to pitch our tent just before the hut next to the creek, such a magical spot (I shouldn’t mention the mosquitos every night after sunset). After setting up our camp we headed up to the Labyrinth, a beautiful plateau at 1300m with lakes and views to Mount Geryon and The Acropolis, two peaks of the Range which we planned to climb. <br> The next day we headed of to climb the west face of The Acropolis, a 7pitch grade 15 climb. The forecast for the day was 30+, so we chose the face that would be in the shade the longest. Getting to the start of the climb involved already a 2hour climb scrambling along the rock face next to a 200m drop. Unfortunately the area of the climb showed a rockfall that must have occurred just recently and we decided to give that one a miss, no need to kill each other on Christmas day by kicking loose rocks on our heads. So we just followed the normal route up to the top. We were lucky with the weather and enjoyed amazing views, in all directions wildness and no sign of civilisation at all. What a great Christmas day topped with a nice dinner and a good bottle of wine. <br> The next day the forecast predicted showers so we used it as an excuse to take a rest day, the two very hot days with lots of action took it out of us and we were planning a 12hour+ day to climb Mount Geryon the next day. It was nice to just relax, read and enjoy our amazing campspot which we had all to ourselves. <br> To allow us enough time for the climb next day we got up early and started hiking at 6:30am. To get to the base of the mountain we had to follow a path that is not shown in maps and is only marked by little orange strings tied to trees. It was quite amazing, if you lost the path you were lost and had to backtrack to the last orange string and look for the next walking in all possible direction. We got the hang of it after a while and felt like the turtles from ‘Finding Nemo’ in the current…once you were in it it was easy but if you didn’t pay attention you were out of it. 4hours later of path finding and scrambling up to the mountain face we finally started our 5 pitch grade 9 climb up to the Foresight peak of Mount Geryon. It was a great place to climb, the peak is in-between the intimidating North and South peak. It was good and exposed climbing. Unfortunately the clouds arrived with us on the peak that fits maximum 4 people. Apparently this mountain gets climbed twice a year, that’s how remote the area is. After a quick celebration sandwich we continued our journey down to beat the clouds coming in. Three 50m abseils, 2hours down scramble and the flow through the orange stream we returned 13.5hours later at our campsite, what an epic adventure. <br> The predicted rain started during the night and didn’t stop for the next 24hours. Our paradise turned into one big puddle and we woke up in a water bed since our tent was pitch in the middle of it…our ropes stored next to the tent soked up all the water to make sure we got a proper work-out on the way out. After hiking out in the rain, which completed to hike in all different weather conditions in Tasmania, we took the ferry back to civilisation and a nice steak for dinner, it tasted like the best steak ever, how sweet are these treats after 5days in the wild.",

		"text": "The weather in the mountains started to turn a bit for the worse  so we decided to hit the beach for a few days until it turned around.  What better place to go in Tassie than Freycinet.  With its white sandy beaches and granite peaks. We started with a couple of nights at Mayfield bay, a delicious camp site right on the beach around from Freycinet peninsula itself, where we enjoyed ocean views, camp fires and a very German dinner of Pretzels and sausages with Obazdn one night. From here were able to launch a day climbing trip to the super cool location of lost falls.  A 100m abseil into the forest below and adjacent to a waterfall and climbing back out.  Luck the climbing was fairly straightforward and the mosquitoes left some blood in us.  Back at Mayfield bay, although a slice of paradise,  we struck out with luck for neighbours. Having a couple who acted like they were on the set of neighbours.  Living out their daily dramas on the public stage for all to hear. Unlike the TV show they weren't restricted to the 530pm time slot.  So we decided to head off to the next site.  A quick study of the climbing guide brought a spot called White Water Wall to our attention.  A climbing spot and camp on the ocean side of Freycinet and only accessible by 4WD. We headed that way and discovered an awesome climbing spot with climbs up from the ocean and a cliff top climbing site.  We enjoyed an afternoon of quality climbing and a beer on the cliff top at sunset. Too bad about the mosquitoes which are a bit of a recurring theme here. After White Water Wall we set out to the main attraction of Freycinet, wine glass bay, reported to be in the top 10 beaches in the world depending on who you ask. We started the hike with the bus loads of tour groups.  But unlike the bus tours we grabbed the packs with dinner and water for the peninsula hike.  We got over to wine glass bay in good time and checked out the magnificent vistas from Mount Amos as one does. From there we headed south to Cooks beach via the challenging 12km hike over Mount Graham.  A gut busting 600m vertical  climb straight up and down again.  But worth every step. We arrived at Cooks beach in perfect time for a skinny dip on a deserted beach and to set up camp literally on the beach and to enjoy dinner and sunset from the beach.  Maybe wine glass bay sneaks in the top 10 beaches.  But for us Cooks beach definitely  comes in at least one higher. ",

		"text": "After checking the weather forecast we decided to head straight to the Cradel Mountain National Park, it looked we had one nice day to have a crack at the Cradel mountain Skyline Traverse. It's a grade 3+ climb that takes all day and follows the Cradel Mountain ridge line. We had an early start at 5:30am to give us enough time. At 7am we started hiking with a cloudless sky and no wind. We forgot right away about our heavy packs admiring the views of the mountain silouette reflecting in Dove lake. Two hours later we started our climb, leaving the heavy backpacks behind to avoid being pulled of the face. It was very exciting, and at times scary, to climb and scramble up and down the dolorite rock with it's amazing column structure. We abseiled down the Weindorfer's peak, named after the Austrian who together with his wife established the park. After 5hours we reached the actual Cradel Mountain peak running into all the tourist on their day hikes. After 10 hours of hiking and climbing we arrived at the Scott-Kilvert Memorial hut, very happy but exhausted. After dinner we crawled in our tent and slept for 12hours straight. The rain woke us up. The weather had completly changed. The forecast had predicted snow down to 800m that day, we just didn't really believe it... we found ourselves spending all day in the hut admiring the snowstorm outside, drinking tea, practicing yoga and reading our books. A nice relaxing day. The next morning didn't look much better but we didn't bring enough food to stay for another night so we started off early bashing our way through winter-wonderland and snowfall back to the car. With wet shoes but a big smile we arrived at the Cradel Mountain Campgound knowing a warm shower would await us there. After warming up the weather actually changed around again and summer was back. So we headed back into the park, visiting the Weindorfer's Charlet and enjoying a beer with the beautiful Cradel Mountain view, realising that nearly all the snow from this morning had already melted again. We also spotted around 15 Wombats, seems like they are enjoying the views there as well.",

		"text": "5 weeks in Tasmania and not much more than a handful of ideas strung together. It didn't strike us until about halfway across the Tasman that we didn't actually have a plan for that night. We had a look at the map and at the climbing guide and decided on a spot about 100km west of Devonport called Black River. With some climbing around Rocky Cape. We set off in that direction and arrived at camp about 10pm. <br> We woke up the next morning to a lovely camp site on the mouth of the Black river. We spent the morning there relaxing, doing yoga on the beach and shooting the breeze with a local about camping spots. An idea in the back of our minds was to check out the Tarkine. But we couldn't even find it on the map. Turns out it often goes by the indigenous name Takayna or the locals name Arthur-Pieman. Apparently it was very close.  Before we headed that direction we went to check out Rocky Cape.  A really scenic peninsula with an interesting crag of quarzite about 40m high. Got a couple of really nice climbs, a dip in the ocean and a view of the sunset over the ocean. Perfect 1st day of the trip. <br> The next few days we headed into the Tarkine.  Jeremy had been fascinated by the Tarkine since the coffee table book about the region came out 25 or 20 years ago. It lived up to the hype. Absolutely lush temperate rainforest.  Rugged shore lines and abundant wild life. We saw limestone arches and sinkholes,  aboriginal relics, wallabies and wild rivers. The highlight was visiting Corrina where we stayed for 2 nights.  A town consisting of a pub and camp ground and a punt across the Pieman river.  We spent the time paddling a canoe on the Pieman,  walking in the forest seeing Huon pines older than modern civilization, hiking to the peak of Mount Donaldson and chatting with randoms at the pub about the history of the area. Legend has it Arthur was an ex-convict who fled to the area and lacking any proper tucker turned his escape companions into Pies.  Hence the name. True or false. Hard to say.",

Selling all the furniture, giving a lot of stuff to friends and charity and realising that we are about to give up our home got exhausting. So what better way to distract us from all our thoughts by going climbing at Mt. Arapiles. We love that place, that's where our climbing together started and where are still hundreds of routes awaiting us. It was so good to get out of town and on the rock, forget for a few days about all the gumtree ads, things to organise, stuff to sort through ... It was amazing with how much energy we returned and how we knocked the last bit of getting ready to leave Melbourne over.",

		"text": "We, Julia and Jeremy, also known as JB^2, married earlier in 2016 at our favourite park, the ST/ Vincent Garden, with our closest family and friends. We received many generous contributions towards our Honeymoon which were greatly appreciated. The original plan was a trip to South America to take in the Andes and see Schildkroeten (turtles) on the Galapagos. This was initially delayed as we chose to stay in Australia with our amazing overseas wedding guests and go on a Family-Friend-moon in Lorne after our wedding. As the year progressed the plan was delayed further, with Jeremy breaking his elbow in 6+ places in a cycling accident and Julia spending time in India volunteering for Pollinate Energy helping provide solar power to poor communities. However, everything happens for a reason… The extra time provided opportunity to dream up something bigger and bolder. The stars aligned and it became the right time to relocate to Julia’s home country - Germany. In the closing stages of 2016 JB^2 packed up their home into 23 boxes to ship to Munich (mostly Jeremy’s music collection and bikes), sold all their furniture on Gumtree and gave the rest of their possessions away to friends and charities. All that remained was two Rucksacks of clothes, our climbing gear, camping gear, a guitar, our yoga mats, a box of books and our Hilux. We were ready to hit the road for a bit before making the big move to Europe. But as we were saying, we were dreaming bigger. What better time, we thought, was it to take our Honeymoon and being free of a lease and pot plants to water to push the dates out a bit. So we have. We have dreamt up a Honeymoon which will take us to 3 continents and take potentially more than 9 months. It will be tied together with a common thread: our love of mountains. Being in them, climbing them, hiking around them and just generally hanging out around them. The plan is (roughly speaking) to enjoy the Australian summer including time in Tassie, NSW and Vic. Then head to India where we look forward to trekking the Himalaya together and catching up with Pollinate Energy again. Visiting Julia’s sister in China and then arriving back in Europe in time for their summer where we will be hiking the Alps from Italy to finally arrive in Munich. An epic journey which will take in some of the best mountain scenery on the planet. This blog is a record of our travels to capture some of the experiences and destinations of our travels and an opportunity to share them with you, our friends and family.",
